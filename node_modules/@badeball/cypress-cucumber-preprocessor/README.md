This preprocessor aims to provide a developer experience and behavior similar to that of [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/), to Cypress.

## Installation

```
$ npm install @badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor
```

## Introduction

The preprocessor (with its dependencies) parses Gherkin documents and allows you to write tests as shown below.

```cucumber
# cypress/e2e/duckduckgo.feature
Feature: duckduckgo.com
  Scenario: visiting the frontpage
    When I visit duckduckgo.com
    Then I should see a search bar
```

```ts
// cypress/e2e/duckduckgo.ts
import { When, Then } from "@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor";

When("I visit duckduckgo.com", () => {
  cy.visit("https://www.duckduckgo.com");
});

Then("I should see a search bar", () => {
  cy.get("input").should(
    "have.attr",
    "placeholder",
    "Search the web without being tracked"
  );
});
```
